Description: This app allows customers to easily view and update their profile as well as manage their services such as preferred collection day, schedule an additional pick up, or suspend their collection for a period of time. The customer can view their balance in their profile AND in the future be able to make payments right in the application instead of mailing in their monthly payments!
As for the Companies side. Employees will be able to log in and see a list of customers that have service scheduled that day. The employee can also search within different zip codes or view upcoming schedules for other days. Once the employee has made the pick up, they can confirm their service has completed and bill to the customers account.  This view also includes all the customers marked on the map so they can easily plan the most efficient route for their work day.
